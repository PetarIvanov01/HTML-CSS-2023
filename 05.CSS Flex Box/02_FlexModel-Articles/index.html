                <p> The power of music</p>
            </h2>
            We can all think of at least one song that, when we hear it, triggers an emotional response. It might be a
            song
            that
            accompanied the first dance at your wedding, for example, or a song that reminds you of a difficult break-up
            or
            the
            loss of a loved one.

            <h2>
                <p> Reducing pain and anxiety</p>
            </h2>
            By analyzing 72 randomized controlled trials involving more than 7,000 patients who received surgery,
            researchers
            found those who were played music after their procedure reported feeling less pain and anxiety than those
            who
            did
            not listen to music, and they were also less likely to need pain medication.

                <p>An effective stress reliever</p>
            </h2>
            The study researchers, including Prof. Isabelle Peretz of the Center for Research on Brain, Music and
            Language
            at
            the University of Montreal in Canada, suggested the repetitive pattern of the music the infants listened to
            reduced
            distress, possibly by promoting "entrainment".
